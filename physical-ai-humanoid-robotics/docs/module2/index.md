# Module 2: Robot Simulation (Digital Twin)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on robot simulation, which is crucial for developing, testing, and validating robotic systems before deploying them on real hardware.

## Overview

Robot simulation allows us to create digital twins of physical robots and environments. This enables safe, cost-effective testing and development of complex robotic behaviors without the risk of damaging expensive hardware or operating in potentially dangerous real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of robot simulation and digital twins
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models using URDF and SDF formats
- Simulate sensors and physics interactions
- Use Unity for advanced robot visualization and simulation
