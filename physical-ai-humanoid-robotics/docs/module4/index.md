# Module 4: Humanoid Robot Development

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on the specialized field of humanoid robot development, covering the unique challenges and techniques required for creating robots with human-like form and capabilities.

## Overview

Humanoid robots represent one of the most complex and ambitious areas of robotics research. These robots are designed to have a human-like body structure, typically featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs. Developing humanoid robots requires expertise in multiple domains including kinematics, dynamics, bipedal locomotion, balance control, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the unique challenges and design considerations for humanoid robots
- Apply kinematic and dynamic principles to humanoid robot systems
- Implement bipedal locomotion and balance control algorithms
- Design and implement manipulation strategies for humanoid robots
- Develop human-robot interaction capabilities
- Address the computational and control challenges specific to humanoid systems
