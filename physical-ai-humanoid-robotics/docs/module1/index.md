# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for modern robotics applications.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an operating system but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts and architecture of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages with Python
- Work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Configure launch files and parameter management
- Implement basic robot communication patterns
